# analysis-of-kNN-on-music-genres
analyzing kNN performance over classification of audio features for different music genres - Uni project

The main idea is to extract some audio features, from some artists' different songs, and test them on the algorythm. Training is done with 3 songs from one same EP/LP, while testing is done with 3 other various elements of the artist's catalogue.

Most scripts are not my own, many of those are from the MIR Toolbox. Each author is credited within scripts' comments.
